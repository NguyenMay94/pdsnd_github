# Project Overview

This project get perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

You can input 'python bikeshare_2.py' on your terminal to run this program.
### Program Details

The program takes user input for the city (valid city includes: chicago, new york city, washington), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option to apply no month filter), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option to apply no day filter).

* Counts of gender
* Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
